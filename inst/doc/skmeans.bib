  abstract     = {Spherical k-means is a popular algorithm for document
                  clustering. However, it may still yield poor
                  performance in some circumstances. In this paper, we
                  consider a discrete optimization model for spherical
                  k-means. By using the convexity of objective function
                  and specific structure of constraint set, we first
                  reformulate the discrete problem as an equivalent
                  convex maximization problem with linear
                  constraints. Then we characterize the local optimality
                  of relaxed problem. Based on the characteristics, we
                  refine the spherical k-means algorithm by
                  alternatively performing spherical k-means and
                  switching data points between clusters. This strategy
                  guarantees that the refined algorithm can always
                  attain a local optimal solution.}
